# Mono rt2 prerelease

If you came in here after reading the `mono_rt2` flag in your fxmanifest, then you might not want to use it at this time. In short: only use these resources in testing environments as it's not fully released and supported yet.

## Prerelease notes
The mono rt2 environment is currently in prerelease, crashes and bugs are to be expected, and the runtime may be prone to deactivation after the given dates. Using it in production is highly discouraged and no support nor guarantees are given.

Want to start developing and testing this new environment, then [start right here](README.md).
